Pokémon World-Wide Adventures
=============================

Official Repository of Pokémon WWA

So, you want to download dev version of PWWA? It's not as easy as you might think.

What is included it this project:
 -Models
 -Textures
 -Terrain
 -Scenes
 -Scripts
What is not included:
 -Dependencies (see How to make this work:)
 -Sound
 -Music
 -Standart Assets

How to make this work:

1.Fork the repo into a new folder of your choice (don't do anything with it yet!!)
2.Make sure you have all the dependencies: (Buy them or download them, I don't care) (also always use the newest version unless told otherwise)
    -Unity 4.6+ (free version is enough)
    -NGUI (95$)
    -iTween (free)
    -RiverWater (free)
    -UniStorm (60$)
3.Create a new project in unity (THIS WILL BE THE MAIN PROJECT) and name it as you like (i.e. PokemonWWA)
4.Import all the dependencies + Standart Assets + Music and sounds (More in Music and Sounds)
5.Merge the repository into the project folder
    -All the files go directly into the project folder. It should merge correctly.
!!!!IF YOU WANT MUSIC AND/OR SOUNDS GO TO Music and Sounds!!!!
6.Open the project in unity
7.Wait until it imports
8.Profit!



Music and Sounds:

There are no Pokémon music or sound files included in the repo. To make them work, either add them manually, OR READ FURTHER:
1.Download the same files, I'm using. I'm using the OST. For now, I think you should be able to work out with only 
  Fire Red OST. Also! You will need Sound files used for doors. These are only temporary, so If  you want, you can use your own.
2.Add the music files to your project BEFORE importing the repo. I'm not sure if the path has to be the same, but anyway mine is:
"Assets\Music\Pokemon Fire Red & Leaf Green OST" Then there are only the files.
3.The same as above only:
"Assets\Sounds"
4.Now you can finally import the project :)
